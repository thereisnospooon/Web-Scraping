Recipe By Groceries:

This program proposes a recipe by the groceries you have in your house.
The implementation is as follows:
1) The program asks the user for the groceries he has in his/her house
2) The program scrapes the main recipes from "https://www.allrecipes.com/"
3) Then the program offers the user the most suitable recipe it finds.

Thus, the program will be divided into 3 modules -
1) Interface with the user - This module will be responsible for getting the information about the
							 groceries at hand.
2) A module for scraping the web for the most up-to-date recipes
3) A module that calculates what are the best recipes available
